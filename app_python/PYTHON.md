2.1. Virtual environment for the project to not mess all packages
and their versions in the system.
3. Use liners:

3.2. [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)
4. [PEP8](http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) format for my python code.
5. Write tests for your application.

# Best practices for Unit testing

1. Unit tests are checking the functionality of only one function.
2. Unit test need to be as small as possible to quickly understad where the mistakes are.
3. Test code need to be readable, so it is following practices from previous part (Best practices for Python).
